### About

CosCMS is a simple framework for building web application.
It is intended for users, who wants some common modules, and a platform 
with a small code base which is easy to extend.

You can use what ever code and classes you desire when building 
modules - even though it has a few requirements. 
 
It's also a content management system (CMS) 
The CMS is the default build profile included.
 
Easy to use, administer, and extend with modules 
(web- and shell modules, and templates). 
Export websites as simple profiles - which then can be build 
using the shell and git. 

You will need PHP >= 5.3, Apache, and a MySQL database. 

Tested with Apache2 on Debian systems, and Windows. 
Should work anywhere, even though it is build on Debian systems.
